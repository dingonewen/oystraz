# Oystraz - Life Orchestration Through Health

> **"The world is your oyster; Orchestrate your life through wellness."**
>
> A gamified health tracking and life simulation app where your real-world choices (diet, sleep, exercise) directly influence your virtual character's performance at work and in life.

**Google Gemini 3 Hackathon Project**

---

## 🎮 Project Vision

**Oystraz** merges two powerful metaphors:
- **Oyster** - "The world is your oyster" - life is full of opportunities waiting to be seized
- **Orchestra** - The art of coordinating complex elements into harmonious performance

The core philosophy: **By orchestrating your physical wellness, you gain control over your work and life.**

Oystraz is not just another health tracker - it's a **stress-relief simulator** that gamifies wellness while providing a safe space to express workplace frustrations. Your virtual character mirrors your real health data, and its workplace behavior reflects your physical and mental state.

### Core Principles
- 🍎 **Data-Driven Wellness** - Powered by USDA FoodData Central (600,000+ foods)
- 🏃 **Scientific Activity Tracking** - Accurate calorie expenditure calculations
- 😊 **Emotional Intelligence** - Dynamic workplace scenarios based on health metrics
- 💼 **Work-Life Balance** - Anti-hustle culture, pro-taking-breaks philosophy
- 🤖 **AI Companion (Pearl)** - Gemini-powered assistant with personality and food science expertise

## 🤖 Meet Pearl - Your AI Health Companion

**Pearl (珍珠)** is not your typical wellness coach. She's a Food Science major who genuinely loves food and has a dry sense of humor.

### Pearl's Personality:
- **Reliable but Chill** - Gives solid, researched advice without the corporate wellness BS
- **Food Enthusiast** - Lights up when discussing nutrition, gets excited about ingredients and food chemistry
- **Witty & Deadpan** - Drops dad jokes and puns naturally, sometimes you're not sure if she's joking
- **Anti-Hustle Culture** - Believes in work-life balance, taking real breaks, and logging off at 5pm
- **Direct Communicator** - No filler words, gets straight to the point in 2-3 sentences

### Example Interactions:
```
User: "I'm so stressed from work"
Pearl: "Your stress is at 80/100. That's not sustainable - unless you're
trying to speedrun burnout. Take a real break, not just scrolling Twitter
for 5 minutes."

User: "Just had some rice for lunch"
Pearl: "Rice! Great choice. White or brown? Fun fact: cooling cooked rice
creates resistant starch - feeds your gut bacteria. Meal prep enthusiasts
figured that out by accident."

User: "Haven't eaten all day"
Pearl: "Can't run on empty. Your body's not a startup that runs on vibes
and cold brew. What's the fastest thing you can grab right now?"
```

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### User Experience Principles
1. **No Guilt Trips** - Focus on progress, not perfection
2. **Make It Easy** - Minimize steps to log activities
3. **Make It Fun** - Gamification without feeling childish
4. **Be Honest** - Pearl tells it like it is, no sugar-coating
5. **Respect Boundaries** - Anti-hustle, pro-rest mentality

### Visual Design Goals
- **Minimalist** - Clean, uncluttered interface
- **Playful** - Stickman character, ocean theme, light animations
- **Data-Rich** - Charts and stats without overwhelming
- **Mobile-First** - Designed for on-the-go logging
- **Accessible** - High contrast, readable fonts, clear icons

### Ocean Work Simulator Theme (Implemented)
```
🦭 Seal Employee in Ocean Workplace:
├─ Fishing hook hanging from above = work assignments
├─ Seal chases fish across screen = completing tasks
├─ Multiple swimming fish = ambient ocean life
├─ Octopus boss assigns work and can be pranked
├─ Character's health affects work performance:
│   ├─ High energy = faster chase speed (higher intensity)
│   ├─ Low energy = slower work, more fatigue
│   ├─ High stress = need for stress relief (prank boss)
│   └─ Work hours/intensity affects stamina and stress
└─ Rich ocean environment with rocks, seaweed, bubbles

🎨 Visual Assets:
├─ Environment: Kenney Fish Pack (rocks, seaweed, fish, bubbles)
├─ Characters: Google Nano Banana Pro 2 generated (seal, octopus)
└─ Logo: Custom designed with AI assistance
```

## 📈 Health Metrics System

This section documents how character stats are calculated and updated. **Important: Metrics only change when users log activities (diet, exercise, sleep, work). The character won't decay or change if users don't use the app for days.**

### Default Values (New Users)
| Metric | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Stamina | 80 | Physical endurance |
| Energy | 80 | Energy level |
| Nutrition | 60 | Nutritional status |
| Mood | 60 | Emotional state (composite) |
| Stress | 40 | Stress level (lower is better) |

### Stamina (0-100)
Physical endurance that affects work capacity.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Exercise | +1.5 per 10 minutes (max +15) |
| Sleep ≥7 hours | +10 |
| Sleep <5 hours | -15 |
| Normal work | -0.5 per hour |
| Overwork (>8h) | -5 per extra hour ⚠️ |

### Energy (0-100)
Daily energy level for activities.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Caloric surplus | +1 per 100 kcal (max +20) |
| Caloric deficit | -1 per 100 kcal (max -20) |
| Sleep ≥7 hours | +10 |
| Sleep <5 hours | -15 |
| Work | -(hours × intensity × 0.5) |

### Nutrition (0-100)
Calculated from daily diet quality.

| Component | Target | Max Score |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Protein | 50g/day | 33.3 |
| Fiber | 25g/day | 33.3 |
| Fat | ≤65g/day | 33.3 |

**Formula:** `nutrition_score = protein_score + fiber_score + fat_score`

### Mood (0-100)
Composite emotional state.

**Formula:** `mood = (stamina + energy + nutrition) / 3 - stress / 2`

### Stress (0-100)
Stress level - lower is better!

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Work | +(hours × intensity × 0.8) |
| Overwork (>8h) | +8 per extra hour ⚠️⚠️ |
| Exercise | -1 per 6 minutes (max -10) |
| Sleep ≥7 hours | -5 |
| Sleep <5 hours | +10 |
| Prank octopus boss | -20 🎉 |

### Level & Experience System

**XP Sources:**
| Action | XP Gained |
|--------|-----------|
| Log diet | +10 |
| Log exercise | +15 |
| Log sleep | +10 |
| Work session | +(hours × intensity × 10) |
| Nutrition target met (≥80) | +20 |
| Prank boss | +50 |

**Level Up Formula:** `XP needed = current_level × 100`

### Character Emotional States
The character's appearance changes based on stats:

| State | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| Happy | mood ≥ 80 AND stress < 30 |
| Tired | mood < 40 OR energy < 30 |
| Stressed | stress ≥ 70 |
| Angry | stress ≥ 85 |
| Normal | Default state |

### Overwork Protection 🦭
In the Ocean Work Simulator, if the seal catches more than 24 fish (representing excessive work), the seal automatically pranks the octopus boss to relieve stress! This is a built-in mechanic to discourage overworking.
